## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Implement face detection using Haar cascades
- Implement pedestrian detection using HOG + SVM
- Run detection on static images and webcam input
- Compare detection accuracy and runtime performance

---

## ðŸ“¦ Tools & Environment

- Python 3.12 (Anaconda)
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Jupyter Notebook for visualization
- Modular Python scripts for reproducibility

---

## âœ… Status

âœ… Folder structure organized  
âœ… Haar and HOG detectors implemented  
âœ… Batch detection on multiple images  
âœ… Real-time webcam detection code included  
âœ… Notebook demo completed and documented  
ðŸ”œ Final report (optional)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All detection scripts are modular and reproducible
- Image datasets are organized for batch testing
- Notebook includes detection results and code walkthrough
- Future extensions may include deep learning-based detectors (YOLO, SSD)
